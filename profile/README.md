## ALifeLivedFully.com  
A static site built using the Hugo static site generator which is primarily written in HTML, CSS, and JS. Some features are written using PHP, MYSQL, RUST, and WASM. I would also like to host the website on IPFS, and a .onion instance to ensure it stays up.  

**Notes:**
- Standard homepage layout(explained in a video [Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0db5kA4BfQ&ab_channel=TheWebsiteArchitect))
  - include other parts of the website(shop, pay, blog, etc) built-in to the homepage

**Notes:**
can you use the same technology used in atomic swaps to facilitate ecommerce, shipping, and proving someone recieved their package?
seller and buyer lock up funds into an smart contract, seller includes their half of the information needed to release the funds in the package being delivered, when buyer recieves the package they have the ability to release the funds and are incentivized to do so.
